  <h1>BC Admitted Student Portal</h1>
  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>
    Our project is a landing page for recently admitted Bellevue College students. Students will recieve "login credentials" to access the portal, which will include financial, housing, and resource sections, for example. This project is designed to help admitted students connect before arriving on campus by providing maps, photos, and links alike. 
  </p>
  <h3>Purpose</h3>
  <p>
    It will provide resources and links to get students prepared for college. Students can access essential information before they enroll, and it will help streamline the transition from acceptance to official attendance at Bellevue College by providing clear next steps. The portal will be designed to answer questions and encourage students to commit to the school.
